Learning Python

So far it is chapter 10 now of the book Python Crash Course by Eric Mattes and I have learned a lot although some I already started forgetting but it I feel now that I have gained understanding of the basic syntax of Python programming language which will definitely help me in my future endeavor in CCIE enterprise exam. I have learned such concepts as lists, dictionaries, for loop, while loop, if, elif, else among others. There are also the techniques like storing lists, storing lists in dictionaries, making your code less messy and more readable.I also learned about using input and while loops, functions and classes and now I am at learning files and exceptions of chapter 10. After Chapter 11 I feel like I will be able to atleast, decipher understand basic code syntax when presented with a Python code but of course coding from scratch would require more practice and experience but we will get there.
